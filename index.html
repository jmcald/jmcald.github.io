            <img src="assets/images/Profile.jpg" id="profile">

            <p>I am 27 years old. I was born and raised in Kansas City. I went to Kansas State University for four years and am still looking to finish my degree. I am also looking to add web-development to my portfolio of skills.</p>

            <p>A lifelong curiosity has brought me to web development. Many paths I have taken in my education have lead me to what seemed like a brick wall: coding. From speaking with statisticians about genome projects they were working on online, to working with databases while making maps, even just investigating how one would go about making an app (I know, everyone thinks they have the next big app idea) web development seems like the path forward, for me.</p>

            <p>Currently, there is nothing to show in terms of programming skills save the website you  are using now, but that will all soon change.</p>
